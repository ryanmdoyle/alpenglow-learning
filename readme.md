# 👨🏾‍🏫 Student Learning Dashboard 👩🏻‍🎓
This project is for a teacher/student dashboard that will be for creating and managing independent playlists for students.

## Purpose
Unlike solutions such as Google Classroom, the primary purpose of this is not to manage class-wide assignments for students. The purpose of this dashboard is to create playlists for students which they can work through independently.  The plan is to have 3 types of playlists; "Essential", "Standard", and "Challenge."  A student will have a single page to show all subjects/classes, with a graphic showing progress in all of their playlists.

### Essential Playlists
From an academic persprctive, the essential playlists represent topics that would be the most important for a student to understand ot be successful moving forward academically. In terms of the academic "standards," these would be considered to be the ones a teacher would spend the majority of their time working on within the classroom and those that represent the greatest amount of [endurance, leverage, and readiness as discussed here](https://www.allthingsplc.info/files/uploads/identifying-essential-standards-presentation.pdf).

### Standard Playlists
The standard playlists represent the standards that support the essential standards coveres in the essential playlists. While still representing state standards, these would represent those that have less endurance, leverage and readiness.

### Challenge Playlists
These playlists represent those content areas beyond the current grade level, offering opportunities for student advancement beyond the given grade level.

## Initial Goals
The initial goals for this project are:
  1. Student landing page. Shows all playlists sorted by type and class. Students add class by code.
  2. Teacher landing page. Shows simplified version of all student progress, sorted by class.
  3. Pages for playlists.  Playlists can have a series of content, sorted by objectives.
  4. Teacher admin page to add classes, playlists, and resources.
